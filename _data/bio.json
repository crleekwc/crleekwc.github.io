    "summary": "From as far as I can remember I have always had a passion to design and create. This passion has guided me to first pursue a graphic design degree which eventually introduced me to Web Development. Web Development was my first entry into programming and even though I used computers to play many video games, how computers worked were a complete mystery to me. When I was first able to print out "Hello World" in my web browser my eyes lite up in fascination, suddenly I could start to see some semblance of how computers worked. From that time my interest was piqued, I re-enrolled in school and got a second major in Computer Science. Currently I am working as a Software Engineer developing UIs and Web Applications for Praxis Inc.",
