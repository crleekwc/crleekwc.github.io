###Curl
The curl is a file transfer tool. It is a tool that is used in
countless programs to as a internet transfer backbone. It is a useful
for troubleshooting because it supports a plethora of protocols(like
DICT, FILE, FTP, and FTP, plus more) and you can also support things
like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL
Connections, cookies, file transfer resume.

Another useful thing Curl supports is multiple URLs, for instance if
you wanted to test multiple sites you could run curl like this:
curl http://site.{one,two,three}.com
Curl can also do alpha numeric sequences:
curl ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
when you run without any flags "curl http://www.google.com" it will
output the source of the website. When you add the flag -v for verbose
mode you can actually see the header for the request which looks like
this:

  curl http://www.google.com -v
  > GET / HTTP/1.1
  > Host: www.google.com
  > User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
  > Accept: */*
  >
  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  Curl can also spoof header data, for instance say you wanted to test
  load balancing of your site. You can spoof the host information in
  the header to test out your site. The -H flag lets you edit the header
  that is sent in your request.
  curl -H "Host: 1.2.3.4" http://www.testsite.com
  Another useful way to use the -H flag is to get a request from the a
  site but change who the sender is.
  curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4" http://www.testsite.com
  This will send a request from the computer it was issued from then
  when the site replies it will reply back to the Forwarded address.
  One of the uses I mainly use curl for is to download files from a
  website, to do that you just use curl with -o flag and in the
  parameter you just put in the link to the file you wish to download.
  curl http://www.google.com -o "google.html"
  This command will output the source code of www.google.com to a file
  called "google.html".
  Another is example is this
  curl https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz -o "wordpress.tar.gz"
  This command will download wordpress from wordpress's website.
  These are just a couple of ways you can use curl. There are still so
  many ways you can use curl for a whole bunch of applications, it is
  almost daunting how many uses there are for curl.
