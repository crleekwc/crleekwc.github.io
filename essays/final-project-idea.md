## Some of the ideas that we came up with include:

### A app to where students can borrow each others books.
Use case: A way for students to share books in order to save money.

### A app similar to massdrop
Use case: A site where students can collectivly say they want something to try to get a discounts on products.

### Petition app
Use case: A site where students can create petitions for things they would like to see on campus.

### Crime heat map app
Use case: Campus sends out crime reports as to where crime occured. It would be nice to see a heat map for cime.

Beyond the basics: Security guards would have higher level accounts than students, the Security guard accounts would have the permissions to add or edit crimes to the heat map. Students would be able to save filters for what they see on the heat map, for instance say a student doesn't own a moped so moped crimes would be irrelevant to that student he would then have the option to filter out moped crime. Also the purpose of the login will prevent non-UH students from seeing the amount of crime that happens to around campus as to not prevent prospective students from coming to UH.
