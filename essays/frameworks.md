The first experience I had with writing code, was trying to create a website. I was a graphic design major at the time, and I really wanted to combine two things that I loved which was Art/Design with working with computers. I wanted to be able to do the things I loved as a profession, so I learned how to make websites. Around this time it was 2011, this was right as responsive design started to become more important. 

Prior to this we didn't really have devices that could browse the internet, so there were a lot of hacks in order to make your site work on multiple screen sizes. Lot of of these hacks, bogged down your site or they would work on some screens but not all screens or even worse you had a user that was still using IE 6, complaining that they couldn't view the page you made. So you have to basically make multiple versions of the page one version for IE and another version for all the browsers that were not IE. There was also still flash which was the only way to get your site be "cool" and "dynamic". Also prior to this I had no experience working with Javascript or JQUERY which probably would have simplified my life had I known those languages. This just all seemed like a big mess to me and quickly turned into a major headache trying to get all of these components to work together. Eventually I kind of stopped making websites as they became more and more painful to make.

Using a framework is much better than just trying to use HTML and CSS. They provide you with tools that can make creating a site very quick as well as make them responsive. I really wish I learned more about frameworks in the past when I was first learning how to make websites. It could have saved me so much time and frustration had I known about frameworks. 

The most notable example of frameworks making life easier is the use of a grid. In graphic design grids are your most valuable tool in your tool belt. Everything you do in graphic relies on some form of under lying grid, this is how you can make disparate elements on a page seem like they have cohesion. Without a grid, you do not have a layout. When programming for the web, web designers would have to use tables to create some sort of grid structure on a webpage. While this worked for many pages there were some intrinsic problems with this method. The first is tables were not designed to be used in this fashion, so when responsive design came along this ruined a lot of sites. Tables are too ridged and don't offer any flexibility if you wanted certain content to take multiple rows or columns. 

This is were frameworks can help, with a frame work you can easily layout a grid with few strokes. You don't have to worry about the math involved to get equal spacing of columns or the math the even divide your browser viewport into said columns. Also with frameworks you can automatically have your site behave responsively, someone has already done all of that work. Why would you go through all the trouble and do the work again when somebody already created a tool to handle that?

As HTML and CSS become more powerful maybe in the future will not need frameworks. Everyday I keep reading more and more features around HTML and CSS that I wish existed when I first started developing, but that day has still yet to come. In the meantime at least we have frameworks.
