After using meteor these past couple of weeks, I really am beginning to see the value of meteor as a development platform. I have never created an application before aside from creating quick websites, so being able to quickly put together quick layouts and then "wiring up" those elements to perform useful functions quickly seems very powerful. While my initial time with meteor was not without its annoyances, there were times where I wanted to tear my hair out due to not knowing the intricacies of how meteor does things. 
 
AFter learning how meteor works, I am really starting to like working with meteor. There seems to be a ton of useful modules you can download in order to increase the functionality of your applications. I also like how simiple it was to setup routes using the flow router. Another thing that I like about meteor is how you can set up templates for blocks of code, this was always a thing that I wish I was able to do using HTML in order to clean up how the code looks during development.
