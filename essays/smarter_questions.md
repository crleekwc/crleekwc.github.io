The internet feels so empowering with its free flow of information, it is also amazing how quickly you can access to all of that information with just a couple of key strokes. As Users we have an incredibly high expectation of the internet to give us the information we demand and to give it to us now, that it can be incredibly frustrating when it doesn't live up to that expectation. 

It is so easy these days to get frustrated when you're looking for an answer to a programming question on the internet. Sometimes we can forget, while on message boards or forums, that the people helping you in those communities are doing it without compensation. Those helpful Users are spending their free time to try to help answer your question. We are not entitled having our questions answered, though it can be disheartening when you're question on a forum gets no response.

There are definite ways to increase the likely hood that your question will get a reply; having a descriptive yet concise subjects/questions, show how you have already tried to approach the problem, show what research you already looked at.

This link is a good example of how you can ask a smart question, the user has already done prior research in an effort to find the answer himself and it clearly and concisely writes the question. In the body he also adds more to his questions about what specifically he doesn't understand and wants more clarification on.

While this post on the other hand doesn't have a clear or concise question, and the user didn't research similar questions that were similar to their question so the post is flagged as a duplicate.
