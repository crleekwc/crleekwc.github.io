During my time working at the computer lab for the School of Architecture at UH Manoa I had many responsibilities. I was brought on to help students print, manage a small computer lab and do some graphic design work such as making graphics for events. One of the projects I was asked to work on was to give a presentation to the Architecture students about Graphic Design principles. One of the reasons I wanted to take on this project is, when I would help students in the lab to create their presentations many of the students were lacking in their visual communication skill. They were not able to effectively convey what they wanted to say about their projects when they would have to present in front of professors or invited Architects which were aked to critique student work. The students that understood how to communicate visually got more internships, and job offers.

Communication is vital for being able to work well in a team. Visual communication can play a vital role in not just presentations but also when you write code. Writing code that is visually expressive and organized is more maintainable and easier to work with.
