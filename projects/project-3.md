For my job at Hawaiian Airlines I created a tiny little bot that scrapes data off of various analytic sites, to automate the collection of data that I need to write reports on. Instead of going to 5 or 6 sites and grabbing data from each site manually my bot will take data from those sites automatically. The bot uses various methods to log into each site as each sites login is slightly different. Some of the analytic sites include an Akamai dashboard site, a google analytics site, and Adobe omniture plus a couple others.
