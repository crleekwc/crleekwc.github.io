<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/akamai_logo.png">

For my job I created a tiny little bot that scrapes data off of analytic sites, to automate the collection of data that I need to write reports for. Instead of going to 5 or 6 sites to and grabbing data from each site manually my bot will take data from those sites automatically. The bot uses various methods of logging into each site as each sites login is slightly different. Some of the analytic sites include an Akamai dashboard site, a google analytics site, and Adobe omniture plus a couple others.
