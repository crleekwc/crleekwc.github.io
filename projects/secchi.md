#SECCHI.nrl.navy.mil â€“ Web Application Redesign
###https://secchi.nrl.navy.mil
As part of a small development team I helped to modernize this web application. The previous site was developed back about a decade ago and was being maintained throughout the years. Until recently when the company I worked for (Praxis Inc.) was contracted to revitalize the look and feel of this web application. This site has many tool available for Space Scientists to utilize. The most important tool is the database image query tools, this tool allows scientists to search for particular fits files based on a wide variety of parameters and also allows scientists to download those fits files individually or in chunks. It was an exciting project to work on for me and it unlocked opportunities for me and my teamates to meet some of the Space Scientists that do this important work and also allowed us to work on more Space Science projects.
